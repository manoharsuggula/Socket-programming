								PROJECT REPORT

I have submitted two codes Server.py and Client.py which were written in python3.
Host is local host 192.168.43.227 and port number is 65432.
In this project I have used the modules threading, time and socket.
When the server and the 3 clients are connected you will receive the first question and you will have the buzzer.
For attempting the question you can press any key and then ENTER. 
Do not press ENTER without entering any character.
Do not write any unnecessary things. This may effect the Quiz.
You have to press the buzzer in 10 seconds. Else it will go to next question.
The contestant who presses the buzzer will answer the question.
If the answer is true he will be awarded 1 point and if it is false or if you don't answer after pressing the buzzer you will be deducted -0.5.
The player who gets the 5 points first will be thye winner.
If all the questions are done, the game will be a draw.
Clients should not exit in between.
